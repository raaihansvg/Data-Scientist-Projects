## Dataset Scale
The dataset used in this project is considered **large-scale**, consisting of:

- **1,000,000 rows**
- **52 features**
- File size ~ **400 MB**

Handling this dataset requires efficient data processing, proper memory management, and a robust machine learning pipeline.  
The large volume of data helps improve model stability and makes the results more representative of real-world academic patterns.
